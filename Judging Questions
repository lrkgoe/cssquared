1. We created Reach Out with two things in mind, the first was to create a tool to encourage people to help out within their community. The second was to make that as easy for them as possible. Our app strives to bring opportunities and events from grass roots organizers to the volunteers who want to better their community. The resulting app allows both users and organizations to create volunteer events. Volunteers who have the app will immediately have access to a list of events with which they can peruse in their own time. When they find an event that they like, they have the ability to add it to a personal list which makes finding and keeping track of events easily accessible. 

2. For our hack we started with focusing on user flow and creating a solid base for future implementations. We used Android Studio as our development environment for both our Java and XML activities, and we used an array adapter to create the adaptive text that comes from the list of events.

3. In future implementations we want to make a database, streamline our interface, add location based services, and link with Facebook and Google groups to streamline the registration process, allow Google calendar hookup, and make finding events that much easier. As a whole for our first hackathon we are excited by the progress we made, and glad that it worked out the way it did.
